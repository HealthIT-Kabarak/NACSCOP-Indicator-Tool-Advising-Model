### 1.3 Introduction
Nacscop is an organization that leads in response to HIV and STIs. It works in collaboration with the counties and therefore the hospitals within that county. Medical institutions input their data initially using a tool know as ART which ran till 2018 when there was creation of a more detailed tool know as MOH 731. However, both of the tools are currently under use as transition is taking place gradually. The use of two system is creating inefficiency and inaccuracy in data analysis by the organization.

### 1.4 Problem Statement
Data collection tools in NACSCOP are in transition. During the transition two sets are in use for collection and reporting. Thereâ€™s need to have an objective approach to select the indicator to use devoid of human bias and that includes other pertinent facility characteristics.

### 1.5 Objectives
- To create a standardized, user friendly tool for data collection on HIV/AIDS and STIs in healthcare facilities countrywide
- To improve the quality of data collected on HIV and STIs by standardizing dat collection processes and reducing errors in data entry.
- To easen the data collection processes making it faster an highly efficient for healthcare workers.
- To improve the accuracy and completeness of data on HIV/AIDS and STIs which can lead to better targeting and intervention and resources.
- To improve the data management and analysis capabilities, enabling better decision making and monitoring of progress towards national and global HIV/AIDS and STI goals.
